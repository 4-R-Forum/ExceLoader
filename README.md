# ExceLoader
Powershell scripts for loading data in an Excel file where Sheet.name =Type and Column.names = Properties

Using Doug Finke's amazing Import-Excel module from Powershell Gallery, and Aras.IOM.dll these scrips enable users to load data directly from Excel files.

This is not a replacement for BatchLoader, which uses multiple processes and multiple threads for large volumes of data. ExcelLoader is for making loading modest amounts of data as straightforward as possible. Basic understanding of Innovator and AML is required.
